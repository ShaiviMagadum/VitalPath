# VitalPath

VitalPath is a wellness and prevention app designed to help Americans build healthier habits and reduce their risk of obesity and diabetes. It combines fitness tracking, nutrition guidance, sleep and stress monitoring, and an AI-powered health coach into one easy-to-use platform. VitalPath also includes a social “VitalFeed,” where users can share progress and support each other, and a unique AI Health Time Machine that predicts future health trends based on current habits. The goal is to make long-term wellness feel personal, social, and achievable.
